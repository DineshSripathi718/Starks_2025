    <h1>POTATO FRY </h1>

<p> Potato Fry—also known as Aloo Fry—is a beloved Indian side dish that’s quick to make and packed with flavor. It’s essentially sautéed or shallow-fried potatoes seasoned with spices, and it pairs beautifully with rice, roti, or even as a sandwich filling.

</p>
<h2><b>Ingridients</b></h2>
<p>- Potatoes (cubed or sliced)
- Oil (mustard, peanut, or vegetable)
- Spices: turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala
- Tempering: mustard seeds, cumin seeds, curry leaves, garlic, and asafoetida (hing)
- Optional: dry mango powder (amchur) or lemon juice for tang
</p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<li>Prep the potatoes: Peel and cube them evenly. Soak in water for 20–30 minutes to remove excess starch.
</li>
<li>Tempering: Heat oil in a pan and add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, garlic, curry leaves, and hing.
</li>
<li>Saute: Drain potatoes and add them to the pan. Cook on medium heat until half done.
</li>
<li>Spice it up: Add turmeric, chili powder, coriander, cumin, and salt. Stir well.
</li>
<li> Finish: Cook until potatoes are tender and slightly crispy. Add garam masala and amchur or lemon juice at the end
